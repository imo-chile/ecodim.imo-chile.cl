    <div><strong>Current Academic Status : </strong>MSc. in Biological Sciences and Computational Biology, Max Planck Tandem Group in Computational Biology, Universidad de los Andes, Colombia</div>
    <div style="font-style:italic">ECODIM 2016 has been the most enriching academic experience that I’ve ever had during my career until today. It gave me some new perspectives about the things I was doing and the way I wanted to drive my research since then. The academic quality in terms of lecturers, laboratory equipments, supplies and resources exceeded all my expectations. Professors over there did not put a limit to our research goals and outlooks, and I think that is very important in a context of doing and promoting science. ECODIM is a great way to empower young scientists to pursue their research goals and ambitions.</div>

    <div style="font-style:italic">ECODIM was one of the best courses I had during my training as a Master in Microbiology student at the University of Concepcion, Chile, both for the contents (classes, reading of publications) and format of research (field trips, laboratories, etc.), as it culminated in oral presentations and preparation of a poster that was later presented at the Chilean Microbiology Congress. The quality and warmth of the teachers, instructors and colleagues were among the best.</div>

    <div style="font-style:italic">ECODIM has certainly been a fundamental step for my career as a Microbial Ecologist. The excellence of the lectures, workshops and laboratory facilities were beyond my expectations.  I had my first experience with molecular methods, which I am using extensively in my PhD project.  Moreover, I had the opportunity to improve other skills such as using bioinformatic tools, conducting field work in microbial oceanography and with people from different background.  ECODIM also provides a friendly platform to build longstanding networks with both professors and students from all around Latin America. Throughout the course we came up with several ideas of cooperation which we intend to develop over the next years.  I left the course with good friends and great professional perspectives.  I have no doubts that ECODIM has been a milestone in the academic career of all participants.</div>
